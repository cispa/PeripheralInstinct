# Exploits

This part of the repository contains reverse-engineering efforts and the code that can be used to reprogram devices from the web using different Browser APIs.

We cover the following devices:

- `hidpp/`: Logitech Devices using HID++ 1.0 and 2.0++
- `unifying/`: The Logitech Unifying Receiver.
- `ch57x_keyboards/`: CH57X-based macropads
- `zelotes_mouse/`: Zelotes Gaming Mouse
- `webmidi/`: Launchpad MK2
- `modem/`: Hayes Modem

## Other Devices

In `other_devices` we cover some rough reverse engineering efforts performed with
Wireshark. There are `.pcapng` files that contain captures of USB traffic during
the reprogramming of the device. There is a `customparser.py` that extracts the
reprogramming out of the capture. `index.html` contains the WebHID commands to
reprogramm the device.
