# HID++

## Demo

The folder `demo/` provides a custom tool to reprogram Logitech devices based on the HID++ 1.0 and 2.0+ protocols.
It was tested on the devices:
- Logitech G502 HERO
- Logitech G203
- Logitech G305 Wireless
- Logitech G500s

## Reversing

The folder `reversing/` contains some reverse engineering efforts related to Logitech devices.
We used Cl√©ment Vuchener's collection of [HID++ Tools](https://github.com/cvuchener/hidpp) for parts of the reversing.
