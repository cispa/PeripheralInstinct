# WebMidi

This directory contains everything required to flash firmware on the Launchpad MK2.
The code is not really cleaned up but it works.

## How the firmware is built

There is a public repo (https://github.com/dvhdr/launchpad-pro) allowing you build firmware for a different Launchpad Model (Lauchpad Pro).
It has some limitations, e.g., most of the low-level functionality is not provided as source code but as library you link.
The toolkit compiles everything to a normal elf file for an Arm Cortex M4 (or M3, not sure) using a linker script that builds it into a elf containing everything at the correct address (interrupt vectors, etc. The normal way embedded arm firmware works).
The elf is then converted to an intel hex file.
Then, using a provided utility "hextosyx", the intel hex file is converted to a .syx file (essentially a midi file only containing SysEx messages).
This midi file is "played" (i.e., the SysEx messages are sent to the device) to update the Launchpad MK2.

## The files Mason, what do they mean?
* bin2syx: converts a decoded firmware binary blob into a syx file that can be used to update the Launchpad MK2
* launchpad.hmtl: Website to update firmware of the Launchpad MK2.
* launchpad.syx: original firmware update file for the Launchpad Mk2 (version 1.7.1 I think)
* syx2bin.py: converts from syx firmware update files to binary firmware update blobs
* Makefile: make
